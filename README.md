# CircuitDesigns
This is just a place to put my combinational logic circuit designs. 

So, these are primarily circuits made up of logic gates, instead of the electrical circuitry seen in physics.

I am using the open source software logisim http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ 


Here is a functional 4 Bit ALU

If you download [logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and the [ALU circuit](/ALU_4bit.circ)

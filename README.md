# CircuitDesigns
This is just a place to put my combinational logic circuit designs. 

These are just circuits are representaed with logic gates.

I am using the open source software logisim http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ 
If you download [logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and the circuits here you can test it out yourself.

Here is a some functional registers, with a MAR, 256B RAM, and the previous 8bit ALU connected:

Here is a functional 4 Bit ALU:
